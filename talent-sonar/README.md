# Talent Sonar

Talent Sonar is a Next.js application designed to help recruiters and hiring managers find the best candidates for job openings. It provides functionality to match candidates to jobs based on skills and experience, and to draft personalized outreach messages.

This project serves as a demonstration of a layered application architecture, including domain modeling, application services, and infrastructure components (mocked data and placeholders for external services).

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

-   **`/domain`**: Contains the core business logic and type definitions for entities like `Candidate`, `Job`, and `Match`. These are plain TypeScript interfaces and types, independent of any framework.
-   **`/application`**: Holds the application-specific logic (use cases). This includes services like `matchCandidates.ts` for matching candidates to jobs and `draftOutreach.ts` for generating email messages.
-   **`/infrastructure`**: Contains implementations for external concerns.
    -   `data.ts`: Provides mock data for candidates and jobs, simulating a database or external API.
    -   `geminiClient.ts`: (Placeholder) Intended for integration with Google's Gemini API for advanced AI features.
    -   `vectorDb.ts`: (Placeholder) Intended for integration with a vector database for semantic search capabilities.
-   **`/pages`**: Contains the Next.js frontend pages (using the Pages Router model) and API routes.
    -   `index.tsx`: The main UI entry point of the application, providing the user interface for job selection, candidate matching, and outreach drafting.
    -   `globals.css`: Global styles for the application. It's typically imported via a custom `_app.tsx` file (not yet created in this project) in a Pages Router setup.
    -   **`/api`**: Contains backend API route handlers.
        -   `hello.ts`: A sample Next.js API route.
        -   `match.ts`: API endpoint to get candidate matches for a given job ID.
        -   `outreach.ts`: API endpoint to draft an outreach message for a given match.
-   **`/public`**: Contains static assets like images (e.g., `next.svg`, `vercel.svg`). Note: `globals.css` was initially here but moved to `/pages`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
-   npm or yarn

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    # git clone <repository-url>
    # cd talent-sonar
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the `talent-sonar` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Once dependencies are installed, you can start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Key Features

-   **Candidate-Job Matching**: Select a job to see a list of suitable candidates ranked by a match score.
    -   The matching algorithm (in `application/matchCandidates.ts`) considers:
        -   Overlap between candidate skills and job requirements.
        -   Candidate experience relative to job requirements.
        -   Presence of educational qualifications.
-   **Outreach Drafting**: Generate a personalized email template for a selected candidate-job match.
    -   The template (generated by `application/draftOutreach.ts`) includes placeholders for personalization.
-   **Mock Data**: Uses predefined sets of candidates and jobs (`infrastructure/data.ts`) for demonstration.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following API endpoints under `/api`:

-   **`POST /api/match`**
    -   **Description**: Retrieves a list of candidates matched to a specific job.
    -   **Request Body**: `{ "jobId": "string" }`
    -   **Response**: `Match[]` (Array of match objects) or an error object.
    ```json
    [
      {
        "id": "match_job001_cand003_167...",
        "candidate": { "...Candidate details..." },
        "job": { "...Job details..." },
        "score": 95,
        "matchDate": "2023-10-27T10:00:00.000Z"
      }
    ]
    ```

-   **`POST /api/outreach`**
    -   **Description**: Drafts an outreach message for a given candidate-job match.
    -   **Request Body**:
        ```json
        {
          "match": { "...Match object..." }
          // OR
          // "candidateId": "string",
          // "jobId": "string",
          // "score": number (optional)
        }
        ```
    -   **Response**: `{ "subject": "string", "body": "string", "recipientEmail": "string" }` or an error object.

## Configuration Files

-   `package.json`: Defines project scripts, dependencies, and metadata.
-   `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler options.
-   `next.config.js`: Next.js configuration.
-   `postcss.config.js` & `tailwind.config.ts`: Configurations for PostCSS and Tailwind CSS.
-   `.eslintrc.json`: ESLint configuration for code linting.
-   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Potential Future Enhancements

-   **Real Database Integration**: Replace mock data with a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
-   **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and authentication for recruiters.
-   **Advanced AI Integration**:
    -   Utilize the `geminiClient.ts` to enhance outreach message generation (e.g., tone adjustment, summarization of candidate profiles).
    -   Implement `vectorDb.ts` for semantic search of candidates based on job descriptions or vice-versa, using embeddings.
-   **Improved UI/UX**:
    -   More sophisticated filtering and sorting options.
    -   Dashboard for recruiters to manage jobs and track candidate pipelines.
    -   Refine styling and component structure (e.g., move inline styles in `index.tsx` to CSS files/modules).
-   **Testing**: Add unit tests for application logic and integration tests for API endpoints.
-   **Deployment Configuration**: Prepare for deployment to platforms like Vercel or AWS.
-   **Custom App/Document**: For a typical Pages Router setup, consider creating `pages/_app.tsx` (for global styles, layout components) and `pages/_document.tsx` (to customize server-rendered HTML structure).
-   **Styling**: Move inline styles from `pages/index.tsx` into `pages/globals.css` or use CSS Modules for better organization.
